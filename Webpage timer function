#The movie theater has implemented online reservations through their website. From the seat selection page, customers have a limited amount of time to make their selection. You must write a function that counts down and reminds the user that they have limited time to make a selection. When time expires, it must print a timeout message.
Instantiate a variable called mins and assign it a starting value of 10.
Write a while loop that uses the sleep() function and decrements mins from 10 minutes. For each minute:
Print how many minutes remain as an integer.
BUT:
If there are 5 minutes left, print Place your reservation soon! 5 minutes remaining. instead of the integer.
If there are 2 minutes left, print Don't lose your seats! 2 minutes remaining. instead of the integer.
When zero minutes remain, print User timed out. instead of the integer.
Expected output:

10
9
8
7
6
Place your reservation soon! 5 minutes remaining.
4
3
Don't lose your seats! 2 minutes remaining.
1
User timed out.
